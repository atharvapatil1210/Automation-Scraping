# Automation Scraping for Startups

This project automates the process of scraping data from Crunchbase and Google to extract valuable information for businesses, influencers, creators, or visionaries. The scraped data is then enriched, stored, and continuously updated in real-time for easy access and analysis.

## Objective

The project has the following main tasks:

1. **Scraping Latest Data:**
    - Extract emails and data from Crunchbase (companies, contact details).
    - Perform Google searches to identify trending businesses, startups, or creators.
    
2. **Enriching the Data:**
    - Analyze and enhance the scraped data by identifying gaps or opportunities for businesses.
    - Utilize SEO tools like Ubersuggest to evaluate business website performance.
    - Use GPT to provide suggestions and validate missing website information or potential improvement areas.

3. **Continuous Operation and Data Storage:**
    - Ensure the automation script runs in real-time and updates the data continuously.
    - Store and update the collected data in MongoDB.
    - Provide real-time updates via a user interface (UI) with reporting tools and dashboards.
  
## Requirements

- **Python**: Used for scraping, enriching, and storing data.
- **Node.js** and **Express.js**: For building the UI and API server.
- **MongoDB**: For storing and managing the scraped data.
- **Cron**: To schedule periodic scraping tasks.

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
```

### 2. Install Python dependencies
Create a `virtualenv` and install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Install Node.js dependencies
```bash
npm init -y
npm install express
```

### 4. Set up MongoDB (if not already running)
Install and start MongoDB on your local machine. Ensure that the `scraperDatabase` exists and contains the required collections (`google_data`, `crunchbase_data`, and `extracted_emails`).

### 5. Set up Cron Job for Periodic Scraping
The `cron.sh` script is used to schedule the scraping script to run every 6 hours automatically. To add the cron job:
```bash
./cron.sh
```

This will add a cron job that runs the scraping script `index.py` every 6 hours.

### 6. Run the Express.js Server
To run the UI server using Express.js, execute:
```bash
node app.py
```

### 7. Verify MongoDB Data
The `mongo.sh` script can be used to view the data stored in the `scraperDatabase` in MongoDB. Execute the following command to view the data:
```bash
./mongo.sh
```

This will connect to MongoDB, select the `scraperDatabase`, and display the contents of the collections (`crunchbase_data`, `google_data`, `extracted_emails`).

```

## How it Works

1. **Scraping**:
    - The `index.py` script is responsible for scraping data from Google and Crunchbase based on user input or predefined queries.
    - The script extracts email addresses and other useful data from the websites.
    - The data is saved in MongoDB using the `pymongo` library.

2. **Enrichment**:
    - After scraping, data is analyzed to check for missing information or potential improvements.
    - SEO tools like Ubersuggest and AI (e.g., GPT) are used to validate and enrich the data.

3. **Continuous Operation**:
    - A cron job (`cron.sh`) ensures the scraping script runs periodically (every 6 hours).
    - The data is continuously updated in the MongoDB database.

4. **User Interface**:
    - The `app.py` provides a simple web-based UI using Express.js, where users can interact with the scraping system, view results, and download them.
    - Real-time updates can be displayed through the UI, showing the scraping progress and any errors.

## Usage

- **Start Scraping**: Run the `index.py` script or wait for the cron job to trigger the scraping process every 6 hours.
- **View Data**: View the latest data in MongoDB using the `mongo.sh` script or via the Express.js server at the provided endpoint.
- **Download Data**: Use the UI to download scraped data in CSV format.

### Explanation of `cron.sh`, `gui.sh`, and `mongo.sh` Files

#### `cron.sh`
This bash script adds a cron job to run the scraping script (`index.py`) every 6 hours automatically.
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# This script will add a cron job to run the Python script periodically.

# Path to your Python script
SCRIPT_PATH="../index.py"

# Path to the python executable (make sure it's correct for your environment)
PYTHON_PATH="/usr/bin/python3"

# Cron job schedule: every 6 hours
CRON_SCHEDULE="0 */6 * * *"

# Add the cron job (make sure the job does not already exist)
(crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "$CRON_SCHEDULE $PYTHON_PATH $SCRIPT_PATH") | crontab -

# Verify the cron job has been added
crontab -l
```

#### `gui.sh`
This file is used to initialize the Express.js server for the GUI. It installs the necessary dependencies and starts the application.
```bash
npm init -y
npm install express
node app.py
```

#### `mongo.sh`
This script interacts with MongoDB, allowing you to query the `scraperDatabase` and view the data stored in the collections (`crunchbase_data`, `google_data`, and `extracted_emails`).
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Start mongo shell with your database and execute queries
mongo <<EOF
use scraperDatabase

# Show all collections
show collections

# Fetch all documents from 'crunchbase_data' collection and display them
print("Fetching data from crunchbase_data collection...")
db.crunchbase_data.find().pretty()

# Fetch all documents from 'google_data' collection and display them
print("Fetching data from google_data collection...")
db.google_data.find().pretty()

# Fetch all documents from 'extracted_emails' collection and display them
print("Fetching data from extracted_emails collection...")
db.extracted_emails.find().pretty()

EOF
```

This setup ensures that your project is well-organized, automated, and capable of handling real-time data scraping, enrichment, and storage in MongoDB.
